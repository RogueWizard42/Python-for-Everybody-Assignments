# This README will cover the assignment requirements for both 7.1 and 7.2

# I have also uploaded the *.txt file needed to run the program

# 7.1 Write a program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, and print the contents of the file in upper case. Use the file words.txt to produce the output below.
  - **NOTE** For the *.txt file to work with 7.1 you must have the file in the same directory as the *.py file
